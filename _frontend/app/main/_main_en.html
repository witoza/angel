    <p class="md-headline">Your data is safe with us</p>
    <p class="md-body-2">
        User's data is encrypted by algorithm AES with 256 bit key and RSA cryptosystem with 2048-bit key.
        At any time you can withdraw your encryption key and deliver it to the recipients via different channel - thus
        data becomes unreadable for us and only recipients will be able to read it entering correct encryption key.
        Our role is then to publish and notify recipients about stored messages when the time comes.

</center>

<p>

    <span class="md-headline">Step 1: message preparation</span>
<ul>
    <li>user creates a new account in the system</li>
    <li>after logging in the user prepares a set of electronic messages to be send out in case of his death</li>
    <li>the user configures the procedure that checks whether he/she is still alive</li>
    <li>the user configures additional options such as message encryption or notification language</li>
</ul>

<span class="md-headline">Step 2: keeping watch</span>
<ul>
    <li>the system at a specified time intervals sends to the user e-mail containing an unique link. By clicking
        on this link user confirms he/she is alive. If the link is not clicked for an specified period of time, after
        several reminders, the system proceeds to Step 3 - message release.
    </li>
</ul>

<span class="md-headline">Step 3: message release</span>
<ul>
    <li>the system sends previously prepared messages via e-mail to recipients</li>
    <li>system keeps a record of whether each recipient have opened the message prepared for him/her, if after 14 days, the
        message hasn't been opened, we make a manual attempt to contact the recipient
    </li>
    <li>after 7 days of the date of opening the last message, the user account and all the data is permanently removed
    </li>
</ul>

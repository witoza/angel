    <span class="md-headline">What is the Trigger ?</span><br/>
    <span class="md-body-1">
        It is a mechanism that checks whether it's time to send out messages defined by you.
        Messages from the folder <b>{{::i18n("%msg.folder.outbox%")}}</b> will be send out after some (configured) time from the date of your last activity in the system.
        Each login to the system updates the date of last activity. If you do not log in to the system for a certain period of time,
        you shall receive an e-mail containing a link. Clicking on that link updates the date of the last activity.

    <span class="md-headline">When my messages will be send out?</span><br/>
    <span class="md-body-1">
        If you do not log in to the system or click on the link checking whether you are alive (see <i> What is the Trigger? </i>), during the time period defined by you.

    <span class="md-headline">How does my messages will be made available to the recipients ?</span><br/>
    <span class="md-body-1">
        There will be an e-mail send to each message recipient with link to the system where they can read the defined messages.
    </span>

<p>
    <span class="md-headline">Why the message content/attachments are not send directly to the recipient' mailbox ?</span><br/>
    <span class="md-body-1">
        There are several reasons, including:
        <ul class="md-body-1">
            <li>
                we need to know if the e-mail has been received and read by the recipient. If the message is not opened
                within 14 days from send out, our consultant will try to contact the recipient manually
            </li>
            <li>
                for safety reasons we do not send user's data to any external systems from which could be stolen or
                downloaded through an unencrypted access channel
            </li>
            <li>
                the recipients may not want to receive user's data in any form
            </li>
        </ul>
    </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <span class="md-headline">My encryption key has been compromised, what should I do ?</span><br/>
    <span class="md-body-1">
       Remove the compromised account and create a new one.
    </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <span class="md-headline">I forgot the password to my message, can you help recover it?</span><br/>
    <span class="md-body-1">
        It is not possible. If you forget your password, the only thing we can do is to delete the message from the system, decrypting it is technically not feasible.
    </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <span class="md-headline">If you can not recover the password, how will you decrypt a message so it can be read by the recipients ?</span><br/>
    <span class="md-body-1">
        The message will not be decrypted and recipients will be asked to provide the password when they try to open the message - so you need to provide them the password beforehand.

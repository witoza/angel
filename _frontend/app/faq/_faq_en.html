<hr/>
<p class="md-headline">What is the Trigger ?</p>
<p class="md-body-1">
    It is a mechanism that checks whether it is time to publish the messages defined by you.<br/><br/>
    Prepared messages will be made available to their recipients when appropriate(configured) time has passed since your
    last activity on the system.
    Each login to the system updates the date of last activity. If you have not logged in for a period of time you will
    receive an email containing a link, clicking on that link updates the date of the last activity.
    If you do not click on the link and or sign in, the messages will be made available to the recipients.
</p>

<br/>
<hr/>
<p class="md-headline">When will my messages be released ?</p>
<p class="md-body-1">
    If you do not log in to the system or click on the link checking whether you are alive (see <i> What is the
    Trigger? </i>), during the time period defined by you.
</p>

<br/>
<hr/>
<p class="md-headline">How will my messages be made available to the recipients ?</p>
<p class="md-body-1">
    There will be an email send to each message recipient with link to the system where they can read the defined
    messages.
</p>

<br/>
<hr/>
<p class="md-headline">Why the messages are not send directly to the recipient' mailbox ?</p>
<p class="md-body-1">
    There are several reasons:
<ul class="md-body-1">
    <li>
        we need to know if the email has been received and read by the recipient, as If the message is not opened
        within 14 days from send out, our consultant will try to contact the recipient manually
    </li>
    <li>
        for safety reasons we do not send user's data to any external systems from which could be stolen or
        downloaded through an unencrypted access channel
    </li>
    <li>
        the recipients may not wish to receive user's messages in any form
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<br/>
<hr/>
<p class="md-headline">My encryption key has been compromised, what should I do ?</p>
<p class="md-body-1">
    Remove the compromised account and create a new one.
</p>

<br/>
<hr/>
<p class="md-headline">I forgot the password to my message, can you help recover it?</p>
<p class="md-body-1">
    It is not possible. If you forget your password, the only thing we can do is to delete the message from the system,
    decrypting it is technically not feasible.
</p>

<br/>
<hr/>
<p class="md-headline">If you can not recover the password, how will you decrypt a message so it can be read by the
    recipients ?</p>
<p class="md-body-1">
    The message will not be decrypted and recipients will be asked to provide the password when they try to open the
    message - so you need to provide them the password beforehand.
</p>

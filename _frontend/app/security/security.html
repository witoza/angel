        We realize that security of our service is of utmost importance to the users and for us as well.
        <br/>
        Below you can find a summary of security measures taken to secure users' data.
        <br/>
        Note that The System is an open source software, you can extract all the information below from investigating the <a
            href="https://github.com/witoza/postscriptum.co">source code</a>.

<p>
    <span class="md-headline">Communication with The System</span>
    <br/>
    Encrypted using TLS >= 1.0. The SSL certificate is given A+ mark on <a
        href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=postscriptum.co">SSLTest</a>.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="md-headline">Login password</span>
    <br/>
    Login password is verified by comparing value of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt">BCrypt</a> hash
    function from provided password and the BCrypt hash
    stored in Database.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When you try to log-in to your account from non-verified web-browser, you will be asked to provide
    token which is sent to your email. Providing correct token and credentials will verify the web-browser for the
    future, so for the following login you will have to provide only
    correct credentials.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
    <span class="md-headline">Multi factor authentication</span>
    <br/>
    Supported via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm">TOTP</a> codes.

    <span class="md-headline">User Data encryption</span>
    <br/>
    During user signing-up process, random 256-bit <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a> Secret Key is generated (it
    is called User's <i>Encryption Key</i>). It is used to <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption">encrypt and authenticate</a> all user's data
    (messages and files
    content) by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode">AES-GCM</a> mode.
    <br/>
    <i>The Encryption Key</i> is stored in Database encrypted by ephemeral Secret Key which is derived (via <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2">PBKDF2</a>) from user's login password and random salt during
    log-in.
    <br/>
    <i>The Encryption Key</i> is decrypted during the user log-in and stored encrypted in a Cookie for the duration of
    user's session as it is required to perform most of the operations on user's data.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Copy of user's <i>Encryption Key</i> is encrypted by System Operator's <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)">RSA</a> Public Key (the System acts as a <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_escrow">Key escrow</a>). It is needed as the System has to be able to
    access user's data during message release phase.
    <br/>
    It is possible to remove user's <i>Encryption Key</i> from User's profile (and System Operator's copy as
    well)
    if you decide
    to deliver <i>The Encryption Key</i> by your own means to your recipients. This has a potential of improving
    security as The System won't be able to access your data, but can be a little cumbersome as you need to deliver the
    key by your own
    and instruct the recipients what is that key for. You can reinsert the <i>Encryption Key</i> to your profile again
    after the removal to modify or delete some of your messages.
    <br/>
    If <i>The Encryption Key</i> is removed from user's profile, the message release process shall still take place as
    user's metadata (file
    names, recipients addresses, message titles) are not encrypted just for that reason. After message release, when
    recipient clicks on a link to display the message he/she will be prompted to enter correct <i>Encryption Key</i>.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
    <span class="md-headline">Optional message password</span>
    <br/>
    You can apply a password for your message which will AES-256-GCM encrypt your message's content (and
    files)
    on top of the base encryption provided by <i>Encryption Key</i>. That password is ephemeral and not stored anywhere,
    so
    each time you
    open the message you will be asked to provide the correct password. Also the recipient will be asked for the same
    password to open the
    message once it has been released. You can specify a hint to help you to recall and them to figure out the correct
    password.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
    <span class="md-headline">Database encryption</span>
    <br/>
    On top of the base encryption applied for each account, there is another layer of encryption which encrypts whole
    database. In case of Database leak there is no metadata to be extracted from plaintext without Database Encryption
    Key.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
    <span class="md-headline">Data storage</span>
    <br/>
    All of user's data is stored in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>. User's data is always stored
    encrypted, and Database is encrypted as well.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
    <span class="md-headline">User's account</span>
    <br/>
    To create an account in The System we only need your username (email address) and password.
    <br/>
    You can remove your account and all stored data at any time.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
    <span class="md-headline">Message release</span>
    <br/>
    Once the time is right, The System will release your messages.
    <br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        If you removed your <i>Encryption Key</i>, releasing will be done automatically. The recipients will be asked
        to provide correct <i>Encryption Key</i> when they display the message.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you have <i>Encryption Key</i> in your user's profile, we need to decrypt it via System Operator's RSA
        Private Key and generate proper Secret Keys for each of the recipients so they can read the messages. That
        secret key is part of
        a URL which is sent to recipient's mailbox. Just by clicking on a link, user is able read the message. This is a
        semi-automated process as it requires System Operator's attention.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Operator's Private Key is not stored in Database, but offline secured by password.
    </li>
</ul>

</p>

<hr/>

<p>
    <span class="md-headline">Forgotten login password</span>
    <br/>
    Since user's login password is used to derive secret key to encrypt user's <i>Encryption Key</i>, resetting login
    password
    is not simple. It requires System Operator's attention as private key is needed to decrypt user's <i>Encryption
    Key</i>.
    For that reason when resetting forgotten password, user has to wait for System Operator to decrypt <i>Encryption
    Key</i> and hence allow password change.
